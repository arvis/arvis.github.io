<h1>Overview of game customiser. </h1>


<p>
<h3>The problem it tries to solve. </h3>
For many years, enterprises dont know how to keep users engaged. Also usrs dont like ads in general. People love to play casual games like Candy Crash and others.

</p>


<p>
<h3>Idea</h3>
The idea is customisible game templates whare customer can pick game, set his own logo/pictures somewhere and put in in interernet or App store. Users playing games can competete for prizes/ bonus points. Customer also has access to game statistics and can send various ingame messages (for example: only today all items 50% off!)
</p>


<p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<h4>NB! All examples are on proof of conept stage and will look differently(better)</h4>

Main idea is to provide sensible variants by ourselves where customer can put logo, and use customers custom models/sounds only when he agrees to addition payment.


<h4><a href="./clicker/">Clicker game</a></h4>
This game represents clicker genre, where user has to repeatadly click monster to gain expirience and get to new monser. Examples: clicker heroes <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.r2gamesusa.clickerheroes&hl=en">Play store link.</a>

Current game theme is beach. Can be applied to tourism agency or wine shop. Possible variants: harvest gathering, winter wonderland, XMASS, Halloween etc
</p>
